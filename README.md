# javascriptPasswordGenerator

Create a random password generator.  Thi project utilizes the various javasript code such as; Functions to to start and to randomize numbers.  For loops to run code until it creates the chosen length of password. EventListener to operate javascript upon button click. If statements to cause the code to use the proper character type. GetEementById and innerHTMLto print  password to the html.  This was a very difficult project.  It definately pushed my knowledge.
